Answers to questions:

1. Do you have production experience with JavaScript prior to the submission of this code
challenge? If yes, for how long?
Ans: Yes, I have deployed JS applications over Heroku, AWS, and Azure platforms. I have about 2+ years of deploying over these platforms.
2. Do you have production experience with JavaScript Frameworks (e.g React.js, Vue.js,
Angular.js, jQuery, Backbone, Ember etc) prior to the submission of this code challenge?
If yes, for how long?
Ans: Yes, I have worked with all 3 frontend frameworks (React: 2 years; Vue: 1 year; Angular: 1 year;) along with JS and jQuery. I have read upon Backbone and Ember and as they are js based frameworks, it won't be difficult to switch to either of those. I recently got adapted to Nest.js (based on express.js) and Next.js (based on server rendered react)
